<body> I just graduated from Rutgers University with a background in Psychology and Sociology. I have learned to appreciate each and every individual and what they contribute to the society around us. Researching memory retention within the college community, guiding autistic individual through their daily lives, and mentoring high school children with diverse cultural backgrounds has helped to develop my skills to be able to make a greater impact in society. To make this impact it is necessary to understand the difference between what society needs and what society wants.</body>
